You might need to click one or more plus (+) icons to see the whole tree. There should not be a red X to the left of any feature. Once certain that all features will be installed, click Next.
	5.	Another window entitled Custom Setup should then ask you whether you’d like to create a shortcut on the desktop and/or in the Quick Launch Bar. We recommend that you leave at least the first box checked. Decide which to check, then click Next.
	6.	A window entitled Warning: Network Interfaces might then try to scare you. Not to worry, click Yes.
	7.	A window entitled Ready to Install should then appear. Click Install.
	8.	If prompted one or more times whether you would like to install this device software, click Install each time.
